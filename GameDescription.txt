Uproot is a text-based game that takes place in Medieval times. In this game, the King's eldest son, the Prince, is confronted with the death of his mother, the Queen. The Queen encountered a secret that is known only by the King, and when confronting the King and threatening to expose their secret, she is disposed of. None can know he is not the true king, but a shape-shifting impostor. Slain by the False King himself, the King's secret is now safe, or so he thinks. The eldest son, soon to be Prince, is confronted by the King, exclaiming that the Prince's younger brother is responsible for the Queen's death. The Prince then confronts the youngest brother and does away with him without further questioning. Soon enough, the Prince is encountered by a stranger who informs him the King is not who he says he is and he must find his actual father, the True King and remove the False King from the family's rightful throne.
